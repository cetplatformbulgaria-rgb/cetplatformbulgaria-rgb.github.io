<h3>A glance at the social economy in Romania</h3>

<h5>Recognition of social economy</h5>

<h5>National definition</h5>

<ul>
  <li>˗ The social economy is defined as the set of activities organised independently from the public sector, the purpose of which is to serve the general interest, the interests of a community and/or personal non-pecuniary interests by increasing the employment of persons belonging to vulnerable groups and/or producing and supplying goods, providing services and/or carrying out works (Law no. 219/2015 on Social Economy).</li>
</ul>

<h5>Legal forms and entities of social economy</h5>

<ul>
  <li>˗ Co-operative societies, credit co-operatives, associations, foundations, employees' mutual benefit societies, pensioners' mutual benefit institutions, agricultural companies and other forms of association in agriculture, agricultural co-operatives.</li>
  <li>˗ Any other categories of legal persons, irrespective of the field of activity, which comply, according, with the definition and principles of social economy provided for by the Law on Social Economy 219/2015.</li>
</ul>

<p>Source: Data for Romania relates to 2021 (CIRIEC; Euricse; European Innovation Council and SMEs Executive Agency (European Commission); Spatial Foresight, 2024[1]) (OECD, 2023[2]), except data on the involvement with any social economy organisation as a volunteer relating to 2020-2025 (European Commission, 2025[3]).</p>

<h5>Institutional arrangements across levels of government</h5>

<p>In Romania, the Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity largely manages social economy policy while other ministries contribute based on their mandates. The legal framework for the social economy is defined by Law no. 219/2015, which establishes the legal conditions for the functioning of social enterprises and organisations. Other laws also structure the social economy ecosystem, namely the Government Ordinance 26/2000 on associations and foundations, the Law on the Organisation and Functioning of Co-operatives (1/2005) and the Law on Protection of People with Disabilities (448/2006).</p>

<p>Romania</p>

<h3>SOCIAL ECONOMY IN EUROPE: ROMANIA © OECD 2025</h3>

<p>Local authorities have no legislative capacity for social economy and there are no evident formal mechanisms in place. However, certain municipalities and city councils demonstrate support for social economy initiatives. These remain limited.</p>

<h5>National arrangements</h5>

<h5>Institutions</h5>

<p>The field of social economy is overall managed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity, through the Directorate-General for Labour Policies, Employment and Vocational Training. The Directorate-General develops, with the support of social partners and relevant actors, legislation, policies and strategy in the field. Other ministries can contribute to social economy policy, including the Ministry of Investments and European Projects and Ministry of Economy and Digitalisation (European Committee of the Regions, n.d.[4]).</p>

<h5>Competence</h5>

<p>The Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity holds the primary competence for legislation and regulation in the social economy. The Law on Social Economy no. 219/2015 provides the legal framework for social enterprises. This law defines social economy entities and their operational conditions, including the provision of public services or the reinvestment of profits into social objectives. Although it has partially introduced a new type of enterprise, it does not include incentivising or support measures (Petrescu, Lambru and European Commission, 2019[5]). Other ministries such as Ministry of Investments and European Projects can also implement policies and projects around the social economy.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity has a role in co-ordinating public funding programs such as the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), which finances social economy initiatives. For example, the Ministry co-ordinated the Human Capital Operational Programme (POCU), managed by the Ministry of Investments and European Projects. This program establishes investment priorities and specific objectives in the field of human resources, contributing to Romania's goal of reducing economic and social disparities (European Commission, 2023[6]). The Ministry of Investments and European Projects, alongside the National Employment Agency which falls under the Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity, signposts European funding and aim to stimulate employment.</p>

<p>Other relevant policies include the National Strategy for Social Inclusion and Poverty Reduction, which integrates social economy into broader social policies. Specific programs like "Social Enterprises for Employment" have been implemented to provide financial support for social enterprises focusing on employment for vulnerable groups.</p>

<h5>Subnational arrangements</h5>

<h5>Institutions</h5>

<p>Romania is a unitary state with a centralised public administration structure. Romania is administratively divided into communes (comune), towns (oraşe), and counties (judeţe). Larger towns, known as cities, can be granted the status of municipalities (municipii) by a specific law. Regional development councils, consisting of county council presidents, co-ordinate regional development in the eight development regions (European Committee of the Regions, n.d.[4]).</p>

<p>There are no designated regional frameworks to support social economy. There is some evidence of certain regions, like Iași County and Bucharest-Ilfov, being a part of developing partnerships across</p>


<h6>Page 3</h6>

<h3>SOCIAL ECONOMY IN EUROPE: ROMANIA © OECD 2025</h3>

<p>private, public and social enterprises. For instance, the public-private partnership for autonomous families carried out in the region of Bucharest-Ilfov is led by Fundatia Dezvoltarea Popoarelor in partnership with the Directorate-General of Social Assistance and Child Protection (DGASPC) and two social enterprises, SC Proiect Mozaic SRL and Asociatia Touched Romania. The project’s main goal is to create a centre of integrated services provided by this public-private consortia addressed to people at risk of social exclusion (EEA and Norway Grants, n.d.[7]).</p>

<h5>Municipal arrangements</h5>

<h5>Institutions</h5>

<p>There are no designated local authorities or municipal frameworks for the social economy. Romania is divided into 41 counties (județe) and the municipality of Bucharest, which function as administrative-territorial units but do not have legislative powers. While counties and municipalities have certain delegated responsibilities, the main legislative and regulatory authority lies with the national government (European Committee of the Regions, n.d.[4]).</p>

<p>At county and Bucharest level respectively, the county employment agencies and the Bucharest Employment Agency issue the social enterprise attestation, which recognises the status of social enterprise. Some municipalities, such as Cluj-Napoca and Timișoara, have example initiatives in supporting social innovation and inclusive entrepreneurship through partnerships, incubators, or municipal funding programs. These remain limited.</p>

<h5>Competence</h5>

<p>Employment agencies, in collaboration with certified social enterprises and local and county public social assistance services, develop a County Socio-Professional Insertion Plan covering a three-year period. These plans are aligned with national strategies and priorities. Each year, employment agencies submit a report to the National Employment Agency, evaluating the implementation of the measures and actions outlined in the plan. Additionally, local public administration authorities offer certain facilities to social insertion enterprises. These facilities are provided upon request, based on a supporting memorandum that justifies the need and timeliness. In some cases, local authorities may allocate specific funds in their budgets to support these facilities.</p>

<p>Certain municipalities have demonstrated competence for strategy setting or support often aligned with EU priorities and partnerships. For example, In Cluj-Napoca, the Urban Innovation Actions project “Cluj Future of Work (CFW)” was conceived to create a socially resilient working ecosystem for current and future jobs in the city, and imagine a technologically-enriched future that is safe, ethical, inclusive and sustainable (Urban Innovative Actions, n.d.[8]). In Timișoara, partnerships between the city council and NGOs, such as Pentru Voi Foundation, aim to support various activities of social inclusion (Timisoara, 2023[9]).</p>

<h5>Co-operation mechanisms</h5>

<p>Certain networks exist to support the activities of entities relevant to the social economy such as co-operatives and federations.</p>

<h5>Across multiple public authorities and/or levels of government</h5>

<p>In 2022, the Ministry of Labour and Social Solidarity (MMSS), with World Bank support, established the Social Economy Community of Practice (SECoP). This platform brings together public institutions (e.g., MMSS (MMSS, 2025[10]), National Agency for Public Procurement (ANAP, 2022[11])), social economy organisations (e.g. Civitas Foundation for Civil Society (Civitas Foundation, n.d.[12])), and experts to share operational knowledge and address implementation challenges for the labour-market integration of vulnerable groups (OECD, 2023[2]).</p>

<h5>With social economy representatives</h5>

<p>In addition to SECoP, other umbrella bodies are more clearly active and focus efforts on advocacy for social economy entities. For example, the Romanian Network of Insertion Social Enterprises (RISE) promotes the social, professional, and economic integration of disadvantaged individuals in Romania through the development of social enterprises (RISE, 2025[13]). Additionally, the National Federation of NGOs for Social Services (FONSS) is an umbrella organisation of social service providers aiming for inclusive communities and sustainable, quality services for all. It advocates for the involvement of NGOs in policy development and supports Romanian NGOs in the social services sector.</p>

<h3>Business development support</h3>

<h5>National business support</h5>

<h5>Support from the public sector</h5>

<p>A coalition of sector organisations successfully proposed a legislative reform to embed social goals in public procurement. The law was amended to require public authorities with procurement budgets above EUR 3 million to reserve at least 0.5% of contracts for certified Work Integration Social Enterprises (WISEs). The partners also secured government agreement to set a minimum quota for direct procurement from WISEs, and jointly organised training events on socially responsible procurement. These measures are designed to create stable market opportunities for social enterprises and integrate social objectives into mainstream public purchasing (ADV România, 2025[14]).</p>

<h5>Support from the private sector</h5>

<p>Romania’s social economy is supported by a dynamic private-sector ecosystem, including national networks and consortia that represent social economy entities. For example, Rețeaua Română a Economiei Sociale (RISE Romania) is a national network of work integration social enterprises that advocates for better policies and offers mutual support programmes (Slov-Lex, 2018[15]). The Federation of NGOs for Social Services (FONSS) comprises 44 non-governmental organisations dedicated to providing social services to vulnerable groups and supporting other Romanian non-governmental organisations (FONSS, n.d.[16]).</p>

<p>Traditional organisations, such as co-operatives and mutual aids, also have umbrella organisations representing their interests and supporting their activities. Examples include the Romanian National Union of Handicraft and Production Co-operatives Association (UCECOM) and the National Federation of Mutual Aid Houses for Pensioners (CARP Omenia) (CECOP, n.d.[17]) (Federatia Nationala Omenia, n.d.[18]).</p>

<p>New financing initiatives have emerged to address the funding gap for social enterprises. For example, the AFIN – Social Investment Fund project (2024–27), led by ADV Romania with EU backing, aims to establish a dedicated investment fund offering tailored loans and business development services to social economy actors.</p>

<p>Complementing this effort, the “Support for the Social Economy” de minimis scheme, approved in September 2024 by the Ministry of Investments and European Projects, provides over EUR 96 million to strengthen the financial capacity of social enterprises and work integration social enterprises (Ministry of Investments and European Projects, 2025[19]).</p>

<p>Designed with input from ADV Romania, AFIN and the Social Finance Association, and administered by FNGCIMM, the scheme combines portfolio guarantees and grants to facilitate access to financing of up to EUR 500 000 for investments, working capital, digitalisation, the green transition and social inclusion.</p>

<p>In addition, Romanian actors such as Fonduri Structurale – a platform that has supported social enterprises access EU grants and runs accelerators – and the crowdfunding platform consolid8 (Romania’s first reward-based crowdfunding platform dedicated to social entrepreneurs) have introduced alternative financing and ecosystem-building mechanisms for the social economy.</p>

<p>International organisations are also key drivers of the social economy sector in Romania. For instance, Ashoka Romania and NESst Romania both offer mentoring and seed funding to social entrepreneurs, often running incubation and acceleration programmes, workshops and competitions to build the sector’s capacity (Ashoka, n.d.[20]) (NESsT, n.d.[21]).</p>

<p>Another example is the MARC Impact Programme, established in 2024, which is an international accelerator initiative implemented across Central and Eastern Europe. Designed to enhance the financial readiness and social impact of social enterprises, the programme is a collaborative effort of various stakeholders such as the ERSTE Foundation, Erste Social Finance Holding, IFUA Nonprofit Partner, and SIMPACT (MARC, n.d.[22]).</p>

<p>NGOs and foundations also act as intermediaries and support hubs for social economy organisations. The Alături de Voi Foundation (ADV Romania) has become a leader in promoting the social economy by operating its own social enterprise, running an accelerator for social enterprises, and founding the country's first social economy cluster.</p>

<p>Microfinance and social banking services have become more accessible within the Romanian ecosystem for social economy entities. A notable example is Erste Bank, which provides micro-loans and financial literacy programmes to support social entrepreneurs.</p>

<p>A specialised institution under Banca Comercială Română (BCR), BCR Social Finance IFN, also offers tailored financial solutions to social enterprises, non-governmental organisations, and micro-enterprises, particularly those in disadvantaged communities.</p>

<h5>Subnational business support</h5>

<h5>Support from the public sector</h5>

<p>Romania's regional governments and municipalities have recently increased their support for the social economy. For example, the Regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry facilitates networking opportunities, promotes events, and fosters collaborations between traditional businesses and social enterprises (Voinea, 2024[25]).</p>

<p>The County Agencies for Employment (AJOFM) facilitate employment services by offering matchmaking, training and unemployment benefit services. They establish partnerships with social enterprises and supports them through subsidy programmes for the inclusion of vulnerable people (European Committee of the Regions, n.d.[27]).</p>

<p>European-funded projects at regional level are also key pillars of support for the social economy ecosystem. A noteworthy example is the MicroFuture project (2023-27), operating under the Interreg Europe programme.</p>

<p>The Danube4SEecosystem initiative focuses on developing inspiring policies for social enterprises by involving local public authorities. It aims to enhance inclusive employment in the Danube region while supporting the sustainable operation of social enterprises (Interreg Danube Region, n.d.[29]).</p>

<p>Romania is also leveraging EU funding through its Regional Development Agencies (RDAs). RDAs facilitate access to European Cohesion Policy Funds of approximately EUR 1 billion for the 2021-27 period.</p>

<h5>Support from the private sector</h5>

<p>The Civitas Foundation launched the Social Business Academy, a programme aimed at training future social entrepreneurs in rural areas, co-funded by the European Union. Each selected social enterprise receives EUR 61 000 in non-repayable grants.</p>

<p>The Romanian Federation of Community Foundations supports local social innovation projects and capacity building across its member foundations.</p>
